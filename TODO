- ability to set timeouts for reading or writing into a socket:
  - for blocking implementations use SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO
  - for asynchronous implementations use perun.after to schedule a thread; when thread is resumed, a corresponding event should be removed from kqueue and context.listeners; this can be done in addition to SO_RCVTIMEO and SO_SNDTIMEO
